‚Ä¢ Temperature readings (Coolant, Hydraulic Oil, Spindle Bearing)
‚Ä¢ Vibration measurements (Spindle, Tool)
‚Ä¢ Operational metrics (Spindle Speed, Voltage, Torque, Cutting Force)
‚Ä¢ Downtime indicators (Machine Failure vs No Machine Failure)

üîç Key Findings
‚Ä¢ Random Forest and XGBoost achieved near-perfect performance (~99% accuracy, ROC-AUC ~0.9998)
‚Ä¢ Critical predictors: Spindle_Vibration, Torque(Nm), Hydraulic_Pressure, Coolant_Temperature, Spindle_Speed
‚Ä¢ Balanced dataset with proper class distribution between failure and non-failure cases
‚Ä¢ High correlation between Spindle_Vibration and Tool_Vibration identified

üìà Model Performance
‚Ä¢ Logistic Regression: Accuracy ~87%, ROC-AUC ~0.94
‚Ä¢ Random Forest: Accuracy ~99%, ROC-AUC ~0.9998
‚Ä¢ XGBoost: Accuracy ~99%, ROC-AUC ~0.9998
‚Ä¢ SVM: Accuracy ~89%, ROC-AUC ~0.96

üöÄ Technical Implementation

‚Ä¢ Hydraulic_Pressure(bar): Deviations can indicate hydraulic system problems
‚Ä¢ Coolant_Temperature: Overheating may lead to component wear and failures
‚Ä¢ Spindle_Speed(RPM): Irregular speeds can reflect operational inefficiencies

üí° Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Deploy high-performance models for real-time prediction
‚Ä¢ Focus on key predictive features for monitoring
‚Ä¢ Integrate predictive models with maintenance scheduling
‚Ä¢ Maintain and update models regularly with new data
‚Ä¢ Enhance data collection and quality protocols`,

    title: 'Renewable Energy Trends Analysis',
    description: `This project analyzes global renewable energy trends using a comprehensive dataset covering energy production, investments, policies, and economic factors that shape renewable adoption worldwide. The analysis was conducted as part of a data science challenge to uncover insights about the global transition to clean energy.

üéØ Mission
As a data analyst, the mission is to explore multi-dimensional renewable energy data and uncover powerful insights about global trends. The analysis addresses key questions such as:
‚Ä¢ Which regions are investing most efficiently in renewables?
‚Ä¢ How do economic, environmental, and policy factors relate to production levels?
‚Ä¢ What drives successful renewable energy adoption across different countries?

üìä Dataset Overview
The analysis uses a rich global renewable energy dataset with 2,400 observations and 31 features covering energy metrics, innovation & technology, economy & policy, social & governance, and environment & resources.

üîç Key Findings
‚Ä¢ China, Japan, and India lead in investment efficiency (GWh produced per USD invested)
‚Ä¢ Investment efficiency shows the strongest positive correlation with production levels
‚Ä¢ Renewable energy production shows temporal growth over the years
‚Ä¢ Hydro and Wind energy types show substantial production globally

üìà Statistical Analysis
‚Ä¢ R-squared: 0.017 ‚Äì Model explains ~1.7% of variance in Production (GWh)
‚Ä¢ Year (p < 0.001): Positive and significant, confirming temporal growth
‚Ä¢ Average Annual Temperature (p = 0.003): Positively associated with production
‚Ä¢ Investment Efficiency (p ‚âà 0.068): Marginally significant

üéØ Policy Recommendations
‚Ä¢ Focus on Investment Efficiency - Countries should prioritize efficient use of renewable energy investments
‚Ä¢ Leverage Natural Resources - Temperature and renewable resource availability significantly impact production
‚Ä¢ Strengthen Public-Private Partnerships - These show positive correlation with production levels
‚Ä¢ Set Clear Renewable Energy Targets - Countries with targets show better performance`,

• Temperature readings (Coolant, Hydraulic Oil, Spindle Bearing)
• Vibration measurements (Spindle, Tool)
• Operational metrics (Spindle Speed, Voltage, Torque, Cutting Force)
• Downtime indicators (Machine Failure vs No Machine Failure)

🔍 Key Findings
• Random Forest and XGBoost achieved near-perfect performance (~99% accuracy, ROC-AUC ~0.9998)
• Critical predictors: Spindle_Vibration, Torque(Nm), Hydraulic_Pressure, Coolant_Temperature, Spindle_Speed
• Balanced dataset with proper class distribution between failure and non-failure cases
• High correlation between Spindle_Vibration and Tool_Vibration identified

📈 Model Performance
• Logistic Regression: Accuracy ~87%, ROC-AUC ~0.94
• Random Forest: Accuracy ~99%, ROC-AUC ~0.9998
• XGBoost: Accuracy ~99%, ROC-AUC ~0.9998
• SVM: Accuracy ~89%, ROC-AUC ~0.96

🚀 Technical Implementation
• Applied SMOTE for handling class imbalance
• Feature engineering: extracted temporal features from date data
• Comprehensive model evaluation with multiple metrics
• Feature importance analysis for predictive insights
• Stratified train-test split (80/20) for robust evaluation

🎯 Key Predictors of Machine Downtime
